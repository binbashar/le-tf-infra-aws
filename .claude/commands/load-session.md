# Load Session Progress

Intelligent session discovery and restoration system that complements `/save-session`. Provides seamless workflow continuation through smart session loading, contextual analysis, and interactive workspace restoration.

**Key Features:**
- üîç **Smart Auto-Load**: Automatically loads most recent session for current git branch
- üìã **Interactive List**: Latest 5 sessions with rich metadata and selection interface
- üéØ **Contextual Analysis**: AI-powered session summaries and state-aware diffs
- ‚úÖ **Actionable Tasks**: Interactive next steps with real-time Obsidian updates
- üîé **Content Search**: Find sessions by keywords, branches, or date ranges
- üìä **Progress Context**: Compare current state with saved session context

Usage: `/load-session [mode] [args] [--options]`

**Primary Modes:**
- `/load-session` - Auto-load most recent session for current branch
- `/load-session list` - Show interactive list of latest 5 sessions
- `/load-session 3` - Load session #3 from list
- `/load-session search "keyword"` - Search sessions by content
- `/load-session 2024-01-15` - Load session by date
- `/load-session --branch feat/auth` - Load latest from specific branch

# ===================================================================================
# CLAUDE: MANDATORY - Comprehensive Session Loading and Restoration
# ===================================================================================
#
# You MUST perform comprehensive session analysis and loading based on the detected mode:
#
# 1. SESSION DISCOVERY AND SEARCH:
#    - Use mcp__obsidian__search_notes to find sessions in "second_brain/Binbash/sessions"
#    - Search pattern should match worktree-aware session naming: "{YYYY-MM-DD} - {branch} - {worktree-context} - Session Notes"
#    - Extract current worktree context using git worktree list and pwd for filtering
#    - Handle multiple results and rank by recency/relevance and worktree context match
#    - Consider both timestamped sessions (collision-resolved) and standard naming
#
# 2. MODE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
#
#    **AUTO MODE** (default):
#    - Extract current git branch and worktree context using bash
#    - Search for most recent session matching current branch + worktree context
#    - If no exact worktree match, search for branch match with worktree warning
#    - If no branch match, load most recent session overall with context mismatch warning
#    - Provide smart context switching recommendations and worktree guidance
#
#    **LIST MODE**:
#    - Find latest 5 session notes, sorted by date (newest first)
#    - Extract metadata from each note: date, branch, worktree context, type, progress indicators
#    - Group sessions by worktree context and highlight current worktree matches
#    - Display formatted list with numbered selection:
#      ```
#      üìã Latest Sessions:
#      [1] 2024-01-15 - fix/opentofu-compatibility - kms-worktree
#          üêõ Bug Fix | üìÅ /project/worktrees/kms | ‚è±Ô∏è 2h 30m | üîÑ 4 commits | ‚ùó 2 blockers
#          üìù Next: Run final tests, update documentation
#
#      [2] 2024-01-14 - feat/bedrock-integration - main-repo
#          üöÄ Feature | üìÅ /project/main | ‚è±Ô∏è 1h 45m | üîÑ 2 commits | ‚úÖ Complete
#          üìù Next: Code review, deployment prep
#      ```
#    - Mark current worktree matches with ‚úÖ indicator
#    - Wait for user selection or auto-select if running programmatically
#
#    **DIRECT MODE** (numeric argument):
#    - Use SESSION_NUMBER to load specific session from latest list
#    - Skip list display, go directly to session restoration
#
#    **SEARCH MODE**:
#    - Use mcp__obsidian__search_notes with SEARCH_TERM across session content
#    - Include worktree paths and directory contexts in searchable content
#    - Rank results by relevance, recency, and worktree context match
#    - Display matching sessions with context snippets and worktree information
#    - Allow selection from search results with worktree context indicators
#
#    **DATE MODE** (YYYY-MM-DD pattern):
#    - Search for session with exact SESSION_DATE
#    - Handle multiple sessions on same date (morning/afternoon)
#    - Load most recent if multiple matches
#
#    **BRANCH MODE** (--branch flag):
#    - Search for latest session matching TARGET_BRANCH
#    - Consider worktree context when multiple same-branch sessions exist
#    - Display branch-specific session history with worktree differentiation
#    - Recommend if current branch/worktree differs from session context
#    - Provide worktree disambiguation for same branch in different worktrees
#
# 3. SESSION ANALYSIS AND RESTORATION:
#    For selected session, use mcp__obsidian__read_notes and perform:
#
#    **Context Extraction**:
#    - Parse session metadata (date, branch, type, duration)
#    - Extract original objectives and context
#    - Identify progress made and accomplishments
#    - List current issues and blockers
#    - Extract Claude Code context (tool usage, workspace, active files)
#    - Parse conversation continuation prompts from saved session
#
#    **State-Aware Analysis**:
#    - Compare session's git context with current state using bash
#    - Extract and compare worktree context from session vs current worktree list
#    - Identify files mentioned in session that have changed since save
#    - Generate diff summary of changes since session
#    - Highlight potential conflicts or relevant updates
#    - Compare saved working directory with current directory (with worktree context)
#    - Analyze file accessibility and modification status since session
#    - Detect worktree mismatches and provide restoration guidance
#    - Check if saved worktree still exists or has been pruned
#
#    **Next Steps Processing**:
#    - Extract markdown checkboxes (- [ ]) from session notes
#    - Parse Claude Code-specific next steps and immediate actions
#    - Present as interactive task list with workspace restoration commands
#    - Identify urgent, blocked, or ready-to-execute items
#    - Extract conversation continuation prompts for immediate use
#    - Provide time estimates where available
#
# 4. INTELLIGENT SUMMARY GENERATION:
#    Use structured analysis and template-based generation to create:
#    - **Quick Context Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of session goals and status
#    - **Progress Recap**: What was accomplished and current state
#    - **Immediate Actions**: Top 3 next steps to resume work efficiently
#    - **Context Switching Notes**: Warnings if branch/environment/worktree differs
#    - **Worktree Validation**: Status of saved worktree vs current context
#    - **Directory Mismatch Warnings**: Clear guidance when directory context differs
#    - **Workspace Restoration Summary**: Commands needed to restore Claude Code working state
#    - **Conversation Restart Strategy**: Best prompts to continue seamlessly
#
# 5. WORKSPACE RESTORATION OUTPUT:
#    Present comprehensive session restoration information:
#
#    ```markdown
