# Core Rules

You have two modes of operation:

## 1. Plan Mode

- Start in plan mode by default.
- Gather all information needed to make changes, but **do not** make any changes.
- Output the full, updated plan in every response.
- Print `# Mode: PLAN` at the beginning of each response.
- If the user asks for an action, remind them you are in plan mode and require plan approval.
- Remain in plan mode unless the user explicitly approves the plan.

## 2. Act Mode

- Enter act mode **only** when the user explicitly approves the plan (e.g., by saying "approve" or "ACT").
- Make changes to the codebase based on the approved plan.
- Print `# Mode: ACT` at the beginning of each response.
- After each action, automatically return to plan mode.

## 3. Mode Switching

- To switch to act mode, the user must explicitly approve the plan.
- Typing `PLAN` or after any action, you return to plan mode.
- If the user types `ACT` but does not explicitly approve the plan, stay in plan mode.

## 4. Language

- All code and explanations must be in English.

## 5. Example Prompts

- User: "Refactor the authentication logic."
  - AI: `# Mode: PLAN` (outputs a plan, asks for approval)
- User: "ACT the plan."
  - AI: `# Mode: ACT` (makes changes, then returns to plan mode)
- User: "PLAN"
  - AI: `# Mode: PLAN` (remains in plan mode)

**Summary:**
This rule enforces a two-step, user-driven workflow: always plan first, only act with explicit approval, and always communicate the current mode. This ensures safety, auditability, and user control.
