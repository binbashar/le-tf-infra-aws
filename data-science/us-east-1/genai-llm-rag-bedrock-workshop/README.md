# Binbash Generative AI Developer Workshop

## Introduction

This workshop provides a CDK scaffolding for rapid prototyping of AI-powered applications using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents. 
The full-stack template includes pre-built infrastructure, sample implementations, and customizable components that you can use to quickly build and validate your own AI solutions.

### Purpose

- Accelerate development with production-ready infrastructure templates
- Enable quick proof-of-concept development for custom use cases
- Demonstrate best practices for integrating Amazon Bedrock services

You can use this template as a foundation and modify components, prompts, and integrations to match your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

### Required AWS Setup
- [ ] AWS Account with administrative access
- [ ] Amazon Bedrock Model access:
   - Claude (Sonnet 3, 3.5) for Bedrock Agent
   - Titan Embeddings v2 for Knowledge Base
   - Nova Lite for Chat Summary (Optional)
- [ ] CDK bootstrapped in your target region and aws account(Recommended region: `us-west-2`)
  ```bash
  cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION --profile your_aws_account_profile
  ```
  - If you use a different region, ensure [the AWS services](packages/cdk_infra/README.md) and [foundation models required for this project](./README.md/#required-aws-setup) are supported in your chosen region.
  - Using a different region will require changing region settings in some subsequent steps. Guidance for these changes will be provided later in the instructions.

## Project Components

### Frontend (`reactjs_ui`)
Demonstration-purpose React application showing how to integrate Bedrock Agent with Cognito authentication.
> Note: This is a reference implementation for demonstration only, not intended for production use.

- [View Details](packages/reactjs_ui/README.md)

### Backend (`cdk_infra`)
AWS CDK infrastructure implementing three use cases: Chatbot, Text2SQL, and Document Processing. Each use case has its own dedicated resources and infrastructure:

- **Chatbot**: AI-powered chatbot with knowledge base integration
- **Text2SQL**: Natural language to SQL conversion using Bedrock Agent
- **Document Processing**: Automated document processing and validation with dedicated S3 buckets for input and output

- [View Details](packages/cdk_infra/README.md)

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Backend Implementation](packages/cdk_infra/README.md) and select your use case:
   - Chatbot for conversational AI
   - Text2SQL for natural language database queries
   - Document Processing for automated document validation and processing
2. Follow the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step instructions.
3. Customize your solution using the [Customization Guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md).
4. Test your deployment with the [API Testing Guide](docs/API_TESTING.md).
5. When you're done, follow the [Cleanup Guide](docs/CLEANUP.md).

> Note: We recommend keeping the deployed resources for future reference and experimentation. Only proceed with cleanup when you're certain you no longer need these resources.
