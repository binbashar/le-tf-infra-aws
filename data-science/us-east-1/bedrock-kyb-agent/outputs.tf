# Outputs will be added progressively as resources are created in tasks T-002 through T-012
# This ensures validation passes at each implementation stage

# Planned outputs to be added during implementation:
# - S3 bucket names and ARNs (T-002: S3 Buckets Implementation)
# - BDA project name and ARN (T-003: Bedrock Data Automation Setup)
# - Lambda function names and ARNs (T-005: Lambda Functions Implementation)
# - EventBridge rule names and ARNs (T-004: EventBridge Rules Configuration)
# - Bedrock Agent ID and ARN (T-009: Bedrock Agent Configuration)
# - IAM role ARNs (T-011: IAM Permissions Setup)
