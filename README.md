## Binbash Leverage | DevOps Automation Code Library Integration

In order to get the full automated potential of the
[Binbash Leverage DevOps Automation Code Library](https://leverage.binbash.com.ar/how-it-works/code-library/code-library/)  
you should initialize all the necessary helper **Makefiles**.

#### How?
Install the `leverage` cli following its [instructions](https://github.com/binbashar/leverage)

### Why?
You'll get all the necessary commands to automatically operate this module via a dockerized approach,
example shown below

```shell
╭─    ~/Binbash/repos/Leverage/ref-architecture/le-tf-infra-aws/shared/base-network  on   master !2 ······························································································ ✔  at 08:52:43 
╰─ leverage

[DEBUG] Found config file: /Users/exequielbarrirero/Binbash/repos/Leverage/ref-architecture/le-tf-infra-aws/build.env
Tasks in build file build.py:
  apply                          Build or change the Terraform infrastructre in this layer. For instance:
                                    > leverage apply
                                    > leverage apply["-auto-approve"]
  decrypt                        Decrypt secrets.tf file.
  destroy                        Destroy terraform infrastructure in this layer.
  encrypt                        Encrypt secrets.dec.tf file.
  format                         Rewrite all Terraform files to meet the canonical format.
  format_check                   Check if Terraform files do not meet the canonical format.
  init                           Initialize Terraform in this layer. For instance:
                                    > leverage init
                                    > leverage init["-reconfigure"]
  output                         Show all terraform output variables of this layer. For instance:
                                    > leverage output
                                    > leverage output["-json"]
  plan                           Generate a Terraform execution plan for this layer.
  shell                          Open a shell into the Terraform container in this layer.
  validate_layout                Validate the layout convention of this Terraform layer.
  version                        Print terraform version.

📒 **CONSIDERATION:** Fully working `terraform` cli 

For example if you want to check the `terraform state`
1. From your shell navigate to the corresponding leverage architecture layer (eg: `cd shared/base-network/`)
2. `$ leverage shell` 
3. Run MFA script (/root/scripts/aws-mfa/aws-mfa-entrypoint.sh)
      ```shell
   /go/src/project # /root/scripts/aws-mfa/aws-mfa-entrypoint.sh
   [05-07-21 12:24:46] [INFO] MFA: Found 3 profile/s
   [05-07-21 12:24:46] [INFO] MFA: Attempting to get temporary credentials for profile=bb-apps-devstg-devops
    MFA: Please type in your OTP:
   ```
4. Run `terraform state [cmd] (or any other terraform cmd)
