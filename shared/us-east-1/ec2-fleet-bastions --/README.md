# Nebula Backbone

## Overview
1. Open `variables.tf`
2. You'll find 4 layer variables, fill the values as you need:
    * `ec2_instances_count`:  Number of instances to be launched
    * `allowed_ips_udp`: List of IPs allowed to access throught the UDP port 3000
    * `allowed_ips_ssh`: List of IPs allowed to access throught the SSH port 22
    * `allowed_ssh_keys`: List of allowed keys to access throught SSH

## Creating a ssh-key to access the EC2 instances
3. Open a terminal and run:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "YOUR_EMAIL" -f ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.
Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:REDACTED YOUR_EMAIL
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
REDACTED
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Once created, change the permissions:
```
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub
```

Copy the value of `~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub` on the variable `allowed_ssh_keys`, for example:

```
variable "allowed_ssh_keys" {
  type        = list(string)
  description = "List of allowed keys to access throught SSH"
  default     = ["ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAB...."]
}
```

# Applying the module
4. Run Terraform
    1. Run `leverage tf init` to initialize this layer (if necessary)
    2. Run `leverage tf plan` to evaluate the changes that will be made
    3. Run `leverage tf apply` to create/update/delete actual resources

5. After the last command succeeds, it should reveal the output of this layer
    Locate the EIPs for each EC2 instance created:
    ```
        Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

            Outputs:

            instance_count = 2
            private_ips = [
            "172.18.6.58",
            "172.18.9.166",
            ]
            public_ips = [
            "54.91.238.249",
            "3.81.31.195",
            ]
    ```

# Testing
6. Grab one of the `public_ips` values and test the ssh connection:

```
ssh ubuntu@54.91.238.249 -i ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub
